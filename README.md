Vehicle Emission Analysis Project

Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing vehicle emissions using a structured dataset to predict pollution levels and identify factors contributing to environmental pollution. The goal is to provide actionable insights and recommendations to reduce emissions caused by vehicles.

Dataset Description:

The dataset contains the following key features:

Vehicle Type: Type of vehicle (e.g., car, truck).

Fuel Type: Type of fuel used (e.g., petrol, diesel).

Engine Size: Engine capacity in liters.

Age of Vehicle: Vehicle age in years.

Mileage: Distance traveled in kilometers.

Speed: Vehicle speed in km/h.

Acceleration: Rate of acceleration.

Road Type: Type of road (e.g., highway, city).

Traffic Conditions: Traffic intensity (e.g., high, medium, low).

Environmental Factors: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, air pressure.

Emission Levels: CO2, NOx, PM2.5, VOC, and SO2 emissions.

Dataset Source: Collected from environmental monitoring agencies and traffic studies.

Size: ~5,000 records and 18 columns.

Key Objectives:

Analyze the relationship between vehicle characteristics and pollution levels.

Predict pollution levels (CO2, NOx, PM2.5, VOC, SO2 emissions) using machine learning.

Provide recommendations to reduce vehicle emissions.

Approach:

Data Understanding and Preparation:

Loaded and cleaned the dataset.

Handled missing values and encoded categorical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized data distribution and relationships using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

Identified key contributors to emissions.

Feature Engineering:

Selected relevant features based on correlation analysis.

Scaled numerical data using StandardScaler.

Model Training and Testing:

Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Trained models like Linear Regression for predicting emission levels.
